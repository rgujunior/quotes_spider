Mark Twain;['books', 'contentment', 'friends', 'friendship', 'life'];“Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.”;;
Marilyn Monroe;['friends', 'heartbreak', 'inspirational', 'life', 'love', 'sisters'];“This life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.”;;
Bob Marley;['friendship'];“The truth is, everyone is going to hurt you. You just got to find the ones worth suffering for.”;;
Mark Twain;['death', 'life'];“The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.”;;
Mark Twain;['misattributed-mark-twain', 'truth'];“A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.”;;
J.K. Rowling;['truth'];"“The truth."" Dumbledore sighed. ""It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.”";;
Khaled Hosseini;['life'];“But better to get hurt by the truth than comforted with a lie.”;;
Mark Twain;['truth'];“Never tell the truth to people who are not worthy of it.”;;
